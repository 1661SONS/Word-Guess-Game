# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Themed Word Guess Game!

## This desktop app is basically hangman where the user guesses TMNT characters and their food preferences by typing one letter at a time.

* Users are given 10 chances to guess the letters for the solution word in the fields provided

* One the user types a keystroke, Donatello starts typing too. Everyone needs a little encouragement. Each keystroke takes one guess away from the counter and adds the corresponding incorrect keystroke to the "Wrong Letters" box. If the keystroke matches one of the letters in the solution word, it is not taken away from the counter and the letter appears in its corresponding blank field.

* Upon running out of guesses, the game immediately restarts with a new word to guess - but not without Shredder laughing at you first. This also adds one Loss to the score.

* Upon guessing all letters correctly, the game again immediately restarts - but this time the you're rewarded by seeing Michelangelo stuff his face with delicious pizza. One Win is then added to the score.
